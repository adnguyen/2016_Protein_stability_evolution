##Initial notes:    
1) Mechanical forces and bubbles can denature proteins. Be careful in how you pipette.     
2) Minimize contamination: don't touch your face and phone with your gloves and then continue to handle samples   
3) **Everything is done on COLD ICE unless specified otherwise**

##Making buffers: 

We use a commercial buffer SuperB by Covaris Inc with protease inhibitors . 

###Reagents
Protease Inhibitors:   
* Pepstatin-    
* Leupeptin-    
* Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)     
* EDTA
* EGTA

Covaris superB buffer: http://covarisinc.com/products/cryoprep-extraction/extraction-buffers/     


###Recipe
We use the covaris superB buffer which is optimized for isolating Native proteins with 5x protease inhibitors    


|Reagent| Initial Conc.| Final conc| add for 1 mL |
|---|---|---|---|
|Covaris superB buffer| 1X| less than 1x| |
|Pepstatin|
|Leupeptin|
|PMSF|100x| 5x| 50 uL|
|EDTA||||
|EGTA||||
