##Initial notes:    
1) Mechanical forces and bubbles can denature proteins. Be careful in how you pipette.     
2) Minimize contamination: don't touch your face and phone with your gloves and then continue to handle samples   
3) **Everything is done on COLD ICE unless specified otherwise**

##Making buffers for protein isolations: 

We use a commercial buffer SuperB by Covaris Inc with protease inhibitors . 

###Reagents
Protease Inhibitors:   
* Pepstatin-    
* Leupeptin-    
* Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)     
* EDTA
* EGTA

Covaris superB buffer: http://covarisinc.com/products/cryoprep-extraction/extraction-buffers/     


###Recipe
We use the covaris superB buffer which is optimized for isolating Native proteins with 5x protease inhibitors    


|Reagent| Initial Conc.| Final conc| vol to add for 1 mL |
|---|---|---|---|
|Covaris superB buffer|1x | ~1x| 900 uL|
|Pepstatin|1000x|5x|5 uL|
|Leupeptin|1000x|5x|5 uL |
|PMSF|100x| 5x| 50 uL||
|EDTA|500 mM|10 mM|20 uL|
|EGTA|500 mM|10 mM|20 uL|
Total|||1 mL|

##Protein unfolding assay through centrifugation       
**Everything needs to be on ice!!!**    
**Steps:**         
1. Homogenize ants or your favorite ectotherm    
  * Add   
2. Centrifuge 4 C for 5 minutes to remove large particulates and transfer supernatant to ultracentrifuge tube. 
3. Ultracentrifuge 100,000 g at 4 C     
5. Quantify protein concentration     
4. Temperature 50-100 ug of protein (in 50-100 uL vol, so 1 ug/ uL)  treat (in a thermocycler) over 10 points: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 C     
  * Have 4-6 replicates per temperature treatment    
5. Save 2-3 replicates to show that your treatments aren't lost and Ultracentrifuge 100,000 g at 4 C  for the rest of the replicates      
6. Quantify protein concentration and run samples on polyacrylamide gels.  
  *The temperature treated, non centrifuged samples (we refer to them as "TOtal") should not decrease in concentration
  * YOu should detect temperature depedent unfolding across temperatures after ultracentrifugation (fraction non-denatured)
